    SnatchFood is a web application that allows customers to buy food online.
    This makes it more convenient for them and safer than traveling from a distance.
    SnatchFood is easy and convenient to use. The website can easily be understood, and the way it's designed is
    user-friendly. The application portrays different food categories from different restaurants and fast-food chains.
    The application allows the user to save their favorite food for future purposes through my cart section and allows
    the buyer to choose whether they will pay through a credit card or cash on delivery.
